In order to de novo assble the N4_S17_L001 genome SPAde will be used
First activate the conda envirionment 
  conda activate de_novo
Then run the spades application  
  spades.py -k 21,51,71,91,111,127 --careful --pe1-1 N4_S17_R1_L001.cutadapt.fastq --pe1-2 N4_S17_R2_L001.cutadapt.fastq -o N4_spades_output
  k dimers that will be checked is a range from 21 to 127, where 127 is the largest k-mer possible
  The genome will be assembled carefully, using the cutadapt files created during QC
  The output will be a directory called N4_spades_output
Move into the output folder and run quast to quality check
  quast contigs.fasta -o Quast_contigs
Move into the Quest_contigs folder to see analysis
  less report.txt

Table listing the quality statistics of the assembly.
  Number of contigs: 7487
  GC content: 52.10%
  Largest contig: 280799 
  N50: 7242
  L50: 456
  
Discussion of if this is a high quality assembly.
  The N50 of 7242 is nto too far from the total number of contigs of 7487. This means that only 245 contigs were needed for set up half the genome. 
  Additionally the largerst contig is fairly large in size at 280799 bp. However, the entire genome is likely close to 3 million bp, which means that it really only accounts for 10% of the entire genome.
