Activate conda environment (created by "conda create -n annotation prokka augustus")
  conda activate annotation
Move into Resource_Announcement folder where the N4_spades_output directory is located
Copy the contig file that is in the spades output directory into a new directory for prokka annotation
  mkdir prokka_annotation
  cp N4_spades_output/contigs.fasta prokka_annotation
  cd prokka_annotation
As Prokka doesn't work directly with spades output, the fasta contig needs to be slightly reformated so that the gene names are shorter.
  awk '/^>/{print ">N4_" ++i; next}{print}' < contigs.fasta > contigs_names.fasta
Then Prokka needs to be ran 
  prokka --outdir N4 --prefix N4 contigs_names.fasta
